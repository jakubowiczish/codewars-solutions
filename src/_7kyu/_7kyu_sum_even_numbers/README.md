## Instructions

Write a function named sumEvenNumbers, 
taking an array of integers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of the even values of this array.

For example, 
considering this input value: 
[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8],
 then your function should return 30 (because 4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30).
