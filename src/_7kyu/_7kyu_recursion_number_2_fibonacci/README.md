## Instructions

##### 2 - Fibonacci number

In mathematical terms, the sequence f(n) of fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

with seed values

f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 1

##### Your task

You have to create the function fibonacci that receives n and returns f(n). You have to use recursion.
