Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 2! + 3! = 9 is not equal to number itself (123), Then it's Not Strong .

strong_num(2)  ==>  return "STRONG!!!!"

Explanation:
Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 2! = 2 is equal to number itself (2), Then its a Strong .

strong_num(150) ==> return "Not Strong !!"

Explanation:
Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 5! + 0! = 122 is not equal to number itself (150), Then it's Not Strong .
