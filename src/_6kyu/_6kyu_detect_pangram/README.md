## Instructions

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. 
For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, 
because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. 
Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
