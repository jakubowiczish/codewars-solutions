## Instructions

Linked Lists - Length & Count

Implement Length() to count the number of nodes in a linked list.
```
length(null) => 0
length(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null) => 3
```
Implement Count() to count the occurrences of an integer in a linked list.

```
count(null, 1) => 0
count(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 1) => 1
count(1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> null, 2) => 4
```
I've decided to bundle these two functions within the same Kata since they are both very similar.

The push()/Push() and buildOneTwoThree()/BuildOneTwoThree() functions do not need to be redefined.
