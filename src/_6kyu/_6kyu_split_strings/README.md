## Instructions

Complete the solution so that it splits the string 
into pairs of two characters. 
If the string contains an odd number of 
characters then it should replace
the missing second character of the final pair 
with an underscore ('_').

solution('abcdef') # should return ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
```
