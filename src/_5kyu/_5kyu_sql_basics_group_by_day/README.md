## Instructions

There is an events table used to track different key activities taken on a website.
 
For this task you need to filter the name field to only show "trained" events.
 
Events should be grouped by the day they happened and counted.
 
The description field is used to distinguish which items the events happened on.

```sql
"events" Table Schema
id
name (String)
created_at (DateTime)
description (String)
```
