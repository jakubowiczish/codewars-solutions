## Instructions

Task
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ().

Consider an Example :
With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:
```
1 * (2 + 3) = 5
1 * 2 * 3 = 6
1 + 2 * 3 = 7
(1 + 2) * 3 = 9

So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.
```

Notes

The numbers are always positive.

The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).

You can use the same operation more than once.

It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.

Repetition in numbers may occur .

You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

```
Input >> Output Examples:

expressionsMatter(1,2,3)  ==>  return 9
Explanation:
After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression (1+2) * 3 = 9.

expressionsMatter(1,1,1)  ==>  return 3
Explanation:
After placing signs, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

expressionsMatter(9,1,1)  ==>  return 18
Explanation:
After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression is 9 * (1+1) = 18.
