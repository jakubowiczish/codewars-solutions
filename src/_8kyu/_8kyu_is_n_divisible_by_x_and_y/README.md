## Instructions

Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. 

All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

```
Examples:
n = 3, x = 1, y = 3 => true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3
n = 12, x = 2, y = 6 => true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6
n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
n = 12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5
```
