## Instructions

Your task is to find the first element of an array 
that is not consecutive.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 
then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, 
so that's the first non-consecutive number.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and
all elements will be numbers. 
 
The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. 

The numbers could be positive or negative 
and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ] though? ( This is not tested, but you can write your own example test. )
