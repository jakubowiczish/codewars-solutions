/*
The main mode is having a method named main inside a class
and should return nothing but should print a line to the standard output
with the message Hello World! i.e. print the line Hello World! to the console.

For Java the main method should receive String array as parameters
that can be specified when running from console with the command.

In many traditional programming languages can be only one main
for a whole application since it denotes the application entry point.
